# EX 44 C functions to perform enqueue, dequeue, display, peek in Queue using Array.
## DATE: 

## AIM:
To write a C Write a functions to perform enqueue, dequeue, display, peek in Queue using Array.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Define a variables. 
3. Write a functions to perform enqueue,dequeue ,display,peek in Queue using array. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Ask the user to make an input. 
6. Print out the answer. 
7. End   

## Program:
```
char queue[50]; 
int size=10,front,rear,i; 
void enqueue(char data) 
{ 
if(rear<size) 
{ 
if(front==-1) 
{ 
front=0; 
} 
rear=rear+1; 
queue[rear]=data; 
} 
{ 
printf("%c\n",queue[i]); 
} 
} 
void dequeue() 
{  
if(front==-1||front>rear) 
{ 
printf("Queue Underflow\n"); 
} 
else 
{ 
front=front+1; 
} 
 
} 
void peek() 
{ 
printf("%c\n",queue[front]); 
 
} 
 
}
```
